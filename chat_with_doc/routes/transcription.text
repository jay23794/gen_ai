 do you remember zipline upk glass Kamas company AER Grover called it the worst product that he&amp;#39;d seen in his life and Rohit warer the founder of the company was mocked online for months after his episode aired but guess what today in 2024 zipline is still very much in business and the company&amp;#39;s sales have increased significantly I would say at least 20 30 and zipline isn&amp;#39;t alone in their post Shar tank India success I&amp;#39;ve spoken with dozens of Shark Tank India season 1 Founders at this point to find out exactly what happened to their startups after they pitched and some of the responses that I got were pretty shocking so I want to talk about five of these companies today starting with zipline so before walking through that wooden door and being told by anopa that his product was a solution looking for a problem Rohit had sold 1,200 drinking Shields these drinking Shields are a patented invention which is one of the reasons why Rohit felt confident valuing his company at 5 grow rupees when he asked for 75 lak rupees in exchange for a 15% stake in zipline but the Sharks unfortunately didn&amp;#39;t bite and so Rohit ended up walking away from the show empty-handed and honestly completely shocked when I asked him what was going through his head in that moment he said I never imagined that the Sharks would stoop so low it was ungentlemanly to say the least but the lampooning didn&amp;#39;t stop after Ro had stepped off the Shark Tank India stage in fact it continued for months afterwards in the form of Relentless online trolling that rohid described to me as ruthless heartless nothing short of third degree torture 99% of our population would not be able to handle what I faced let alone come out triumphantly like we have and this is actually where rit&amp;#39;s story takes a turn because at the end of the episode unom challenged Ro hit to go out and prove the Sharks wrong and I don&amp;#39;t think any of them actually expected him to successfully rise to that challenge but Against All Odds he did after the Sharks and also India rejected zipline goit decided to take his business elsewhere exporting zipline drinking Shields to Italy and Dubai but he also got to work creating and selling new products too sine introduced coin siiz travel friendly tissues and a wine chiller which is able to keep wine cold with significantly less ice than other cooler buckets thanks in part to these additions zipline sales have grown 20 to 30X in Shark Tank India but here&amp;#39;s the plot twist this is actually rohit&amp;#39;s side hustle his main business is completely different it&amp;#39;s called Warrior electronics and they make fire suppression systems under the brand name we fire this company which Ro describes as his bread and butter has been in business since 2010 and they&amp;#39;ve successfully grown from being a sub dealer to actually becoming a manufacturer that&amp;#39;s known and trusted across India for protecting Enterprises from fire now speaking of fire after our next season 1 company&amp;#39;s episode of Shark Tank India aired one of their warehouses literally went up in Flames so this startup is called alpino it&amp;#39;s a healthy peanut butter brand and it was started by six inex experienced co-founders in 2016 but today they&amp;#39;ve sold more than 100 copies of peanut butter and musle and oats over the company&amp;#39;s lifespan and by the time they pitched on Shark Tank India season 1 they were already doing 15 croes in annual revenue so it&amp;#39;s no surprise that alpino was offered a four shark deal in the tank and this consisted of the Sharks offering alpino the requested 1.5 CR rupes but in exchange for 8% of the company instead of the 2% that alpino was offering and not wanting to dilute so much of their ownership alpino Founders did end up walking off the set of sharkk dang Gia empty-handed but their experience on the show was still very very lucrative for them the episode equated to CWS in rupees in free marketing for the brand propelling them to the number one spot in the grocery category on Amazon and quadrupling their sales in just one week and because of all this growth albino&amp;#39;s annual revenue Grew From 15 crupes to 25 crupes and they were still accomplishing all of this as a fully bootstrapped company everything was going incredibly well for alpino that is until it wasn&amp;#39;t on the 16th of February 2023 the founders of alpino woke up to some shocking news a fire had broken out in their warehouse resulting in a loss of one laak product units and packaging material totaling two Grottoes in value and because of the delays caused by the fire alpino saw an 80% drop in sales and a massive stock shortage with no way of fulfilling their growing backlog of orders and in my experience you learn a lot about Founders and their companies when they&amp;#39;re put in an extremely challenging position like this and what happened next with alpino speaks volumes about their resilience and optimism in May of 2023 after their trial by fire they bounced back by introducing alpino 2.0 and this was a total restart for the company they introduced new packaging and products reached full operational capacity in 3 months and by July of 2023 when they celebrated their seventh anniversary they&amp;#39;d hit a new Milestone of one croop beas in sales in just 3 Days alpino is now in the process of raising a million doll preseries a round from a number of investors including a Bollywood celebrity who&amp;#39;s going to be stepping in as alpino brand ambassador and they&amp;#39;re planning to use these funds to expand into 20 countries in 12 months while simultaneously quadrupling their sales from 25 grupes to 100 grupes in the next 2 and a half years that is a lot of peanut butter and one thing that&amp;#39;s awesome about peanut butter is that it&amp;#39;s great for people who are trying to cut down on their carb intake it has a ton of healthy fats and protein but it&amp;#39;s so low on carbohydrates that it&amp;#39;s keto friendly which is actually what our next founder sahil pry built his entire company around keto India pitched on Shark Tank India on the very first day of filming and when I talked to sahill he told me that because of this he actually didn&amp;#39;t really know how much to expect from the sharks in terms of check sizes or valuations and just to recap on this company&amp;#39;s origin story back in 2017 Sill&amp;#39;s mother underwent a major brain surgery and to take care of her during that 9-month long recovery process sahill and his sister quit their jobs and did everything that they could to help their mom heal including creating a personalized nutrition and diet plan and eventually this evolved into Kido India in 2019 the company&amp;#39;s goal was to bring personalized nutrition to millions of Indians and when sill pitched his business to the Sharks keto India was a profitable bootstrapped company serving 3,100 clients now sahill asked for 1.5 CR rupees in exchange for 1.25% of his company valuing keto India at a massive 120 CR rupes and on mol just couldn&amp;#39;t wrap his head around this valuation given the fact that Kido India was only doing 15 lak rupees a month in Revenue but sahill did manage to get an offer from the other four sharks however this offer was made out of more than 10x devaluation 10 coto&amp;#39;s down from the original 120 croo valuation and not surprisingly sahill walked away from this offer and in hindsight this was probably the best thing that he could have done for his company because just four months after the show aired keto India ended up raising 4.5 CR rupes from some Angel syndicates and hni I kiddo India also eventually rebranded to lioi which is short for live for yourself which is something that they&amp;#39;re enabling their 15,000 plus customers to do by helping them to manage their obesity type 2 diabetes PCOS and thyroid problems through personalized nutrition now even though sahill and the Sharks weren&amp;#39;t able to come to an agreement the marketing that his company got from Shark dank India was transformative in his own words you had a significant number of eyeballs which would otherwise be a big marketing spend for any startup but but this next company didn&amp;#39;t even have the benefit of free marketing they went on shark Dan India and their episode ended up getting cut from season 1 I&amp;#39;m talking about India&amp;#39;s first audio patented Bluetooth speakers brand diywood thisy Wood&amp;#39;s episode is available to watch on YouTube now they uploaded it in 2023 as one of their unseen pitches and in that episode Gan Shukla and ananya Mina asked for 50 lakh rupees in exchange for 3.5% of their company at a 14.28 grot to be valuation and none of the Sharks really countered this or even showed interest in investing but here&amp;#39;s something interesting Gan told me that during their pitch namita asked them what&amp;#39;s the core difference between bod and diywood and G didn&amp;#39;t mince words here he said diywood manufactures all of its goods in India whereas boat manufactures all of their goods in China and this line apparently was actually cut from The Unseen pitches version of the episode 2 so there&amp;#39;s really no way for us to verify that Gan actually said this but we&amp;#39;re going to take him at his word here and Gan believes that DIY Wood&amp;#39;s positioning as a Made in India alternative to made in China speakers actually worked against them because it threatened Aman gupta&amp;#39;s company and the Shark Tank India team wanted Aman to come on for season 2 and season 3 and so they had to cut diywood from the season and if you look at the top comments on the official Shark Tank India episode for diywood on YouTube they&amp;#39;re all mentioning how uncomfortable Aman looks during this episode but anyways today in 2024 diywood has seen significant growth in spite of the fact that they didn&amp;#39;t get the benefit of free publicity from Shark Tank India when they pitched on the show their year the early Revenue was just 17 lakh rupees but Gan told me that that number has jumped up by 40x which would place it at somewhere around 7 CR rupes and they&amp;#39;re targeting to close FY 25 at 25 CR rupes and again that&amp;#39;s without the visibility of season 1 and without receiving any investment from the Sharks although they did go on to raise $500,000 from a number of Angel Investors as well as let&amp;#39;s Venture and they&amp;#39;re in the process of closing a $1 million seed plus round two now while Gan and Ana from diywood didn&amp;#39;t make it onto season 1 this next startups founder did but was told by anob to literally shut his business down which definitely wasn&amp;#39;t the outcome that he was expecting or hoping for I&amp;#39;m talking of course about ruid dadia the founder of Amad based booze Mobility now ru&amp;#39;s idea was pretty simple he wanted to rent out electric scooters to gated communities and he&amp;#39;d actually been in business for 10 months when he pitched on Shark Tank India&amp;#39;s first season he was asking for 40 lak rupees in exchange for 15% of his company at a 2.67 Crow rup valuation but after some negotiating he actually agreed to sell 50% of his company to Venita Singh and ashir Grover for 40 lakh rupees but the due diligence process dragged on for quite a bit longer than rud FID expected it should have taken a week to review booze mobility&amp;#39;s accounts which consisted of four lak rupees in lifetime Revenue but instead due diligence took three months and the opportunity cost of these three months of waiting was huge for Ruth this was a period of time in the company&amp;#39;s Journey where booze Mobility needed this capital from ashir and ven but even after scheduling several meetings with them seeking input and advice and despite the fact that they were going to own a fourth of the business each the funds didn&amp;#39;t come through ultimately booze Mobility walked away after realizing the deal was more trouble than it was worth especially for 50% ownership they bootstrapped the company instead until 2022 when they raised 60 lakh rupees from a couple of Angel Investors valuing them at three CR rupees which was a slight increase from the 2.67 CR rup valuation on the show thanks in part to the publicity that booze Mobility got from being on shark dank India they now have a fleet of 200 scooters and they&amp;#39;ve expanded to three more States apart from Gat and are expecting to close this financial year at one croto in Revenue which is a 25x increase from what they were doing before Shark Tank India oh and they&amp;#39;re also currently in talks to raise a large round of venture capital which will likely value them at 40 cres so it looks like everything ended up working out well for them now before I let you guys go I really think that you&amp;#39;ll enjoy the video that I made about the aftermath of 10 of Shark Tank India SE two startups so go check that out in the top right corner
